# Some Goals

## Long Term

- Do we have to care about the crazy camels
- What strategies should we use when laying the desert tiles
- Get simulation with inputs given simulation - something we can play games using
- How do we decide how "good" something is.
- Use probability computations to generalize to other situations.
- Can information about some situations apply to others.  For example:
    ```
    x
    x _ x
    ```
    to 
    ```
    x
    x
    x _ x
    ```


## Short Term

- get github desktop app installed
- get Matt's simulation code on github
- get inputs ready
- write up Kyle's probability information
